## Description

  A website built for The Space, a new communal workspace company that is opening its doors soon in Portland. The space is a new coworking startup company.  Coworking is the idea of people who share similar interests or values that work for different employers working together in a safe and inviting environment, allowing for collaboration and socialization for people who would otherwise probably be working independently.    

 1.  The Space is very proud of their working environment, and want their online presence to reflect their physical presence.

 2. The Space wants the company to feel luxurious, cool and high-end but extremely welcoming, approachable and inclusive to anyone and everyone.  The want it to feel safe, comfortable, and productive.  

 3.  The Space wants to convey its unique personality.  The describe themselves as funky, more local, less corporate and a little more fun.  

 4.  The Space wants to show off its amenities, including the coffee counter, communal and private working areas, high speed internet, faxing and printing services including art printing, and optional weekly activities such as yoga or flash mobs on Thursdays.   

 5. The space does not want to cater to only tech, but to be attractive to anyone and everyone including artists of all mediums and anyone who feels like the could benefit from a more cooperative and social working environment.


## Process

* Research: Browse websites for companies that seem to have similar values to The Space.  Think about how their designs and aesthetics communicate their personalities.  Consider color schemes, typography, pairing fonts, and general aesthetics.  For the sake of this assignment I will find two or three websites that I like and try to unpack what I get from their layouts and aesthetics.  After doing my research I decided I want to build this application fairly minimally with hints of the colors I pick against a somewhat plain colored ruffly textured background. The colors I plan to use are celtic - #113322, kidnapper - #ddeecc, pale-oyster - #998877, brownish-gray - #665544.  Some of these colors will change some throughout the process.

    1. Wieden and Kennedy.  Wieden + Kennedy's website was surprisingly minimal.  I am sure that is part of what their design plan was, but I was pretty surprised and felt like that stood in contrast to the work that they do for other companies, which usually seems to be more original and unique.  The color scheme is incredibly simple - just black, gray, and white with splashes of orange.  The website makes me feel like the company has a large focus on the people who work there, the clients they work with, and the quality and originality in the projects they create.  The lack of color and distractions and the overall uniformity make it very easy to focus on these things, and the layout emphasizes this by giving you options to navigate to their pages and sections in multiple different ways.  There is a navbar that essentially routes you to the same places as when you scroll through the homepage looking at the different sections and options.  The images of their work space makes it clear that they are proud of their work environments and amenities and the images of the art supplies and cool creations make it obvious that there is an emphasis on creativity and freedom in the projects they work on.  It seems like they think outside of the box while maintaining a focused and professional image of themselves.

    2.  My Masterpiece Art Studio (MMAS).  MMAS appears to be a company that provides artists with a fun and inviting space to work, and families and individuals can also go and take classes or sign up for camps or to receive instruction or direction from other artists.  Their website does a really nice job using minimal coloring with off-white, orange, and green and some textures to help add some depth to the page.  The website is aesthetically pleasing and makes me feel like the studio is probably clean and well organized.  They seem to run a professional environment for any old person to pop into and take advantage of their facilities or resources.  The webpage uses engaging language with descriptions like "create fun, fabulous, imaginative masterpieces" and the font and typography are all very legible.  The company feels professional but fun and creative and inviting.

## Progress

2:29 - At this point I'm still working on my mobile views in sketch, but am adding this to my readme so I can make a commit.  I have 3 more views left for mobile then I'll get to start with tablet and desktop.  

3:34 - I am now done with all of my mobile views and with adding prototyping to all of them.  Now onto tablet homepage and then desktop homepage.

4:00 - I just finished doing the layouts for the tablet and desktop versions. I am now done with the layout portion for today and will now go back and tidy things up and get screen shots of my views for my README.

### Day 2
Today I was focused on coding.  I got a few things set up last night such as the angular framework and I had my routes ready to go so I could come in today and get to the content without worrying about the environment setup.  I was able to finish all except for one of my views for mobile, I didn't get my newsletter view done, but the rest are ready to rock for that size.  I got all of my views set up for the homepage sizes, including multiple media queries that are in an "mq" file in the sass directory.  I had hoped to be able to finish more views at least through the tablet sizes, but I started running out of time and wanted to focus on getting as far as I could on one of the three sizes so I went with mobile.  My layout mirrors my planning pretty well, I kept most of the same images and colors but I did switch up placement on some things.  As I started coding I realized that my wireframes were a little bit ambitious compared to where my capabilities are, but none the less I think I did pretty well following the design steps that have been laid out in our assignments over the last few weeks and the planning I did last week.  This project is one that I plan to continue working on because it could make kind of a cool portfolio piece.  I would have liked to have a little more organization in my sass folder, but I did try to follow 7 to 1 as best as I could.
